Welcome to the SignalPop WebCam
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The WebCam is an open-source technology (based on the original DirectXCapture
open-source project available at directxcapture.wikidot.com) that allows easy
access to WebCams for Windows C# applications.  MyCaffe (curated by  
SignalPop) uses the WebCam for Video Data for Single-Shot MultiBox Detection 
(SSD) video input.

FINAL INSTALLATION STEPS:

To use the WebCam Sample, just declare the WebCam sample and call its
ShowDialg method as shown below:

WebCamSample.WebCamDialog dlg = new WebCamSample.WebCamDialog();
dlg.ShowDialog();


WebCam is also available on GitHub at http https://github.com/mycaffe.

If you are looking for tools to visualize and debug your deep learning
models, check out the SignalPop AI Designer, where you can visually edit 
models, manage training sessions and debug your training in real-time. 
The SignalPop AI Designer now supports SSD, deep auto-encoder networks, 
domain adversarial neural networks (DANN), Policy Gradient and DQN reinforcement
learning.

You can try the SignalPop AI Designer demo version for free at:

You may also want to try the new SignalPop Universal Miner at:
https://signalpop.blob.core.windows.net/wpeupdate/wpe.net.app.setup.exe which 
allows you to mine cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.  In addition the 
Universal Miner has a great set of GPU management tools that help
manage each of your GPU's temperatures whether you are training AI
or mining a cryptocurrency.

For more information on innovative Deep Learning AI development tools that
use the MyCaffe AI Platform, such as the SignalPop Visual AI Designer,
